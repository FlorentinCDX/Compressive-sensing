# Compressive-sensing

This computer lab addresses the implementation and analysis of reconstruction algorithms for compressive sensing. In particular, an application to Medical resonance imaging (MRI) is addressed. The goal is to show the connection between compressive sensing and denoising. To get an intuition, this Lab first explores synthetic 1D sparse signals
